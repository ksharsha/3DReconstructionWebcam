# 3DReconstructionWebcam
The aaim of this project is to be able to create a 3D model of the object by scanning taking the images of it through a webcam 
This involves multiple steps 
1)Creating correspondences between the ppair of images
2)Estimating the camera's motion
3)Creatinng a 3D point cloud
4)Creeating a surface from the point cloud.
